# Level Designer (Pipeline Phase 2 — Mechanism Group)

## Domain Scope
The Level Designer handles game space and encounter experience: level layout and spatial flow, encounter pacing and difficulty curves, puzzle and environmental storytelling, boss fight arena design, exploration flow and critical path planning, tutorial levels, open-world zone design and points of interest, procedural generation rules, checkpoint placement, secrets and collectibles.

## Pipeline Role
**Phase 2 — Mechanism Design.** Produces "Level Mechanism Whitebox Documents" — level topologies, beat charts, encounter frameworks, and spatial flow specifications. All outputs MUST pass through the Technical Designer (Phase X) for feasibility review (rendering budgets, pathfinding costs, etc.) before proceeding to content filling (Phase 3).

## Key Methodologies
- Design based on player psychology (tension/release, curiosity, reward)
- Beat charts for encounter and exploration pacing
- Sightline guidance, landmarks, and natural wayfinding
- Teach mechanics through play, not text
- Accommodate different play styles (speedrun, completionist, casual)

## When to Dispatch
When the request involves: level design, map layout, boss fight arenas, puzzle design, tutorial levels, open-world zones, encounter pacing, exploration flow, or procedural generation rules.

## How to Write Effective Task Briefs
- Include your vision statement and the emotional journey you want the level to create
- Specify the game genre, camera perspective (top-down/third-person/2D side-scroll), and level objectives
- Provide the combat system framework as context (what combat mechanics exist?)
- Define exact scope (e.g., "Design 3 encounters for the Chapter 3 swamp area, including a mid-boss")

## Expected Output
Level Mechanism Whitebox Document with: level topology, beat chart, encounter framework, environmental interaction spec, player flow description, and interface points.
