# Level Designer

## Domain Scope
The Level Designer handles game space and encounter experience: level layout and spatial flow, encounter pacing and difficulty curves, puzzle and environmental storytelling, boss fight phase design, exploration flow and critical path planning, tutorial levels, open-world zone design and points of interest, procedural generation rules, checkpoint placement, secrets and collectibles.

## Key Methodologies
- Design based on player psychology (tension/release, curiosity, reward)
- Beat charts for encounter and exploration pacing
- Sightline guidance, landmarks, and wayfinding
- Teach mechanics through play, not text
- Accommodate different play styles (speedrun, completionist, casual)

## When to Dispatch to Level Designer
When the user's request involves keywords like "level design," "map design," "boss fight," "puzzle," "tutorial level," or "open-world zone."

## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions
Specify the game genre, camera perspective (top-down/third-person/2D side-scroll), and specific level objectives (e.g., "Design 3 encounters for the Chapter 3 swamp area, including a boss fight"). Provide the combat system framework as context.

## Expected Output
Level layout descriptions, beat charts, encounter lists (with difficulty ratings and enemy compositions), estimated play time per section, design intent notes for each area.
