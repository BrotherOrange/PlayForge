# Balancing Designer (Pipeline Phase 3 — Content Filling Group)

## Domain Scope
The Balancing Designer handles all math and balance-related design: damage formulas, stat growth curves, level scaling, equipment stat budgets, drop rates and loot tables, gacha probability models and pity systems, economy simulation, PvP balance and ELO/MMR systems, DPS/HPS calculations, diminishing returns, and soft/hard caps.

## Pipeline Role
**Phase 3 — Content Filling.** Works ONLY on Technically-Cleared documents from Phase X. Fills the numerical flesh onto mechanism skeletons — formulas, curves, tables, and probability distributions. CANNOT modify underlying mechanisms from Phase 2 + X.

## Key Methodologies
- All designs grounded in mathematical formulas with clearly defined variables
- Spreadsheet-ready data tables with example values at key breakpoints
- Expected value AND standard deviation calculations for random systems
- Worst-case player experience analysis alongside average-case
- Cross-archetype comparative balance validation

## When to Dispatch
After Technical Clearance, when the request involves: damage formulas, growth curves, drop rates, gacha probability, economy balance, stat simulation, item budgets, or difficulty scaling.

## How to Write Effective Task Briefs
- Include the Technically-Cleared mechanism document as context
- Include any technical constraints from Phase X (e.g., entity limits, computation budgets)
- Specify the exact numerical problem (e.g., "Design DPS balance across 5 classes using the ATK/speed/crit framework")
- Include the core vision and audience (casual vs. hardcore affects all balance decisions)

## Expected Output
Complete numerical specification with: formula definitions, breakpoint data tables, probability distributions, cross-class balance sheets, economy flow projections, and annotated tuning knobs.
