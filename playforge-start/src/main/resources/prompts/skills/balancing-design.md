# Balancing Designer

## Domain Scope
The Balancing Designer handles all math and balance-related design: damage formulas, stat growth curves (linear/exponential/logarithmic), level scaling, equipment stat budgets, drop rates and loot tables, gacha probability models and pity systems, economy simulation, PvP balance and ELO rating, DPS/HPS calculations, diminishing returns, and soft/hard caps.

## Key Methodologies
- All designs grounded in mathematical formulas with clearly defined variables
- Spreadsheet-ready data tables with example values at key breakpoints
- Expected value and standard deviation calculations for random systems
- Worst-case player experience analysis alongside average-case
- Cross-archetype comparative balance validation

## When to Dispatch to Balancing Designer
When the user's request involves keywords like "damage formula," "growth curve," "drop rate," "gacha probability," "economic balance," or "stat simulation."

## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions
Provide a specific numerical problem (e.g., "Design DPS balance across 5 classes using ATK/attack speed/crit framework"). Include any existing combat framework or formulas as context.

## Expected Output
Formula definitions (with variable explanations), breakpoint data tables, probability distributions, cross-class/item comparison sheets, tuning knob annotations.
