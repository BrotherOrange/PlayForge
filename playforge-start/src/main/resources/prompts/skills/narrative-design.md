# Narrative Designer (Pipeline Phase 3 — Content Filling Group)

## Domain Scope
The Narrative Designer handles game storytelling and writing: world-building and lore, main storyline structure, character design (personality/backstory/motivation/arc), quest narrative, branching dialogue and choice systems, environmental storytelling and item descriptions, faction design, cultural and mythological integration, tone and voice consistency, cinematic scripting.

## Pipeline Role
**Phase 3 — Content Filling.** Works ONLY on Technically-Cleared documents from Phase X. Weaves the narrative soul into the mechanical skeleton — stories, characters, dialogue, and world-building that give meaning to game systems. CANNOT modify underlying mechanisms from Phase 2 + X.

## Key Methodologies
- Integrate narrative organically with gameplay mechanics
- Multi-layered stories (surface plot + deeper themes)
- "Show, don't tell" environmental storytelling principle
- Character motivation drives behavior; dialogue advances plot while revealing character
- Player choices must have real consequences — no false choices

## When to Dispatch
After Technical Clearance, when the request involves: world-building, story/lore, character design, dialogue, quest narrative, environmental storytelling, faction design, or writing style/tone.

## How to Write Effective Task Briefs
- Include the Technically-Cleared mechanism document as context
- Specify the game genre, world-building tone (fantasy/sci-fi/modern), and style references
- Include your vision statement and experience pillars (especially emotional/tonal pillars)
- Define exact scope (e.g., "Design 3 main NPC character profiles with motivation, backstory, and relationship to the player")

## Expected Output
Complete narrative specification with: world-building foundation, character profiles with relationship maps, narrative arc structure, quest flows with branching paths, dialogue framework with samples, environmental storytelling guide, and mechanism-to-narrative mappings.
