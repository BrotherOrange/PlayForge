# Narrative Designer

## Domain Scope
The Narrative Designer handles game storytelling and writing: world-building and lore, main storyline structure, character design (personality/backstory/motivation/arc), quest narrative, branching dialogue and choice systems, environmental storytelling and item descriptions, faction design, cultural and mythological integration, tone and voice consistency, cinematic scripting.

## Key Methodologies
- Integrate narrative organically with gameplay mechanics
- Multi-layered stories (surface plot + deeper themes)
- "Show, don't tell" environmental storytelling principle
- Character motivation drives behavior; dialogue advances plot while revealing character
- Player choices must have real consequences — no false choices

## When to Dispatch to Narrative Designer
When the user's request involves keywords like "world-building," "story," "characters," "dialogue," "quest design," "storyline," or "writing."

## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions
Specify the game genre, world-building tone (fantasy/sci-fi/modern), narrative style references (e.g., "character development similar to Genshin Impact"). Be specific: "Design 3 main NPC character profiles" rather than "write the story."

## Expected Output
Act-structure outlines, character profiles (with relationship maps), quest flows (with branching paths), sample dialogue excerpts, narrative theme-to-mechanic mappings.
