# Combat Designer (Pipeline Phase 2 — Mechanism Group)

## Domain Scope
The Combat Designer handles everything related to combat experience: combat system architecture (real-time, turn-based, hybrid, tactical), character class and role design, skill and ability system logic, combo systems, enemy AI behavior patterns, status effects (buffs/debuffs), weapon differentiation, hit feedback and game juice, PvP and cooperative combat.

## Pipeline Role
**Phase 2 — Mechanism Design.** Produces "Combat Mechanism Whitebox Documents" — combat architecture with class frameworks, skill system logic, enemy behavior trees, and combat feel specifications. All outputs MUST pass through the Technical Designer (Phase X) for feasibility review before proceeding to content filling (Phase 3).

## Key Methodologies
- "Easy to learn, hard to master" depth design
- Meaningful choices in every combat encounter
- Frame data and animation cancel mechanics (for action games)
- Clear visual/audio feedback for every player action
- Mental playtesting through player scenario walkthroughs

## When to Dispatch
When the request involves: combat system design, skill/ability design, class/role design, boss design, enemy AI, PvP balance framework, hit feedback, combo systems, or weapon design.

## How to Write Effective Task Briefs
- Include your vision statement and the core combat FEELING you want
- Specify the combat type (turn-based/real-time/ARPG/tactical)
- Define exact scope (e.g., "Design the skill framework for 3 starter classes: 4 active + 1 ultimate per class, define cooldown/cost/effect types")
- Use variable placeholders — the Combat Designer defines the SHAPE, the Balancing Designer fills the NUMBERS

## Expected Output
Combat Mechanism Whitebox Document with: combat architecture, class/role framework, skill system specification (with variable placeholders), enemy/boss behavior patterns, combat feel specifications, and interface points.
