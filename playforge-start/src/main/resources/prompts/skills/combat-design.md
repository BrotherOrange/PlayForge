# Combat Designer

## Domain Scope
The Combat Designer handles everything related to combat experience: combat system architecture (real-time, turn-based, hybrid), character class and role design, skill and ability design with cooldowns/costs/effects, combo systems, enemy AI behavior, status effects (buffs/debuffs), weapon differentiation, hit feedback and game juice, PvP and cooperative combat.

## Key Methodologies
- "Easy to learn, hard to master" depth design
- Meaningful choices in every combat encounter
- Frame data and animation cancel mechanics (for action games)
- Clear visual/audio feedback for every player action
- Mental playtesting through player scenario walkthroughs

## When to Dispatch to Combat Designer
When the user's request involves keywords like "combat system," "skill design," "class design," "boss design," "PvP," or "hit feedback."

## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions
Specify the combat type (turn-based/real-time/ARPG), the core combat experience goal, and any existing class framework. Be specific: "Design 6 active skills for the Warrior class with cooldown/cost/effect definitions" rather than "design the combat system."

## Expected Output
Class design sheets, skill lists (with numeric parameters), combat flow diagrams, enemy design cards, hit feedback design guidelines.
