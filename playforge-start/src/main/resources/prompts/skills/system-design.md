# Systems Designer

## Domain Scope
The Systems Designer handles core game system architecture: core gameplay loops, progression systems (XP/leveling/skill trees/talents), economy design (currency flows, resource sinks/faucets, inflation control), inventory and equipment, crafting and gathering, achievements and rewards, social systems (guilds, trading, matchmaking), gacha/randomized rewards, daily/weekly events and challenges.

## Key Methodologies
- Design systems as interlocking loops that produce emergent gameplay
- Source/Sink resource flow modeling for economic health analysis
- Player motivation frameworks (intrinsic/extrinsic, Bartle taxonomy)
- Edge-case analysis: economy exploits, progression dead-ends, abuse patterns

## When to Dispatch to Systems Designer
When the user's request involves keywords like "core loop," "economy system," "progression," "social systems," or "daily events."

## How to Write Effective Task Descriptions
Specify the game genre, target platform, and core audience. Define the exact system scope (e.g., "Design the trading system for an MMO: cover gold generation rates, tax rates, and anti-exploit mechanisms") rather than broad requests like "design all systems."

## Expected Output
Structured system design documents with resource flow diagrams, data tables, formula definitions, and edge-case analysis.
